\section{Motivation} \label{sec:intro-motivation}
Clusters of commodity machines have become the dominant platform for high-throughput computing. With the adoption of cloud computing, increasing number of applications must be designed to run across clusters rather than individual machines. Making efficient use of these \emph{warehouse-scale computers} is a major challenge in distributed systems research, with considerable practical implications~\cite{WarehouseScale:2009}.

A distributed scheduler coordinates the cluster, choosing the tasks to run on each machine. The choice of scheduler has considerable ramifications on cluster performance and efficiency. Despite their importance, most schedulers leave much to be desired. In particular, they have limited flexibility, being unable to adapt to differing cluster designs and application requirements.

The Quincy system was developed at Microsoft Research to address these problems~\cite{Isard:2009}. In a striking departure from traditional designs, Quincy represents the cluster and its tasks as a flow network. A solution sending flow from task nodes to compute nodes corresponds to a schedule mapping tasks to machines. Solving the minimum-cost flow problem finds a schedule minimising resource usage in the cluster.

By modelling resources in the cluster explicitly, Quincy naturally adapts to the idiosyncrasies of different hardware. Furthermore, the scheme is highly flexible. Whereas most schedulers have a particular policy hard-coded, in Quincy it is defined by a cost model: a procedure assigning a cost to each arc in the flow network. This allows the system to be easily tuned to particular application requirements.

Cluster throughput under the Quincy system increased by  40\%~\cite{Isard:2009} in early experiments, demonstrating the power of this so-called "flow scheduling" approach. Paradoxically, whilst the flow network representation is critical to realising these benefits, it is also the greatest drawback to the system. The minimum-cost flow problem must be solved every time a new schedule is produced, which is extremely computationally expensive.

The resulting scheduling latency is prohibitive for many applications. Even in situations where the latency is tolerable, there are concerns as to the scalability of the technique. Quincy was originally tested on a cluster of a few hundred machines. The warehouse-scale computers of today may contain tens or hundreds of thousands of machines, with the size of clusters continuing to grow. By contrast, the scalar performance of processors is believed to have mostly peaked, and flow algorithms have limited parallelism.

In this dissertation, I explore approaches to improve the performance of flow algorithms on networks produced by Quincy-style systems. My goal is to enable flow scheduling systems to scale to the largest clusters built today, as well as to still larger clusters which may be built in the foreseeable future. Moreover, I intend to reduce the scheduling latency to allow the system to be used with applications that have hard latency requirements. Together, this will enable flow scheduling systems to be adopted in practice, with the consequent performance and efficiency gains in computer clusters.

\section{Challenges} \label{sec:intro-challenges}
Research into the minimum-cost flow problem has been active since the 1950s, driven by its numerous practical applications. There is consequently considerable prior work from the past 60 years on this problem, which I describe further in~\S\ref{sec:intro-related-work}. It will be necessary for me to assimilate this large body of existing material before I can attempt to improve upon it.

Given that many seasoned researchers have spent their careers working on this problem, realising a significant performance improvement will be difficult. Not only has there been considerable work to develop efficient algorithms, the reference implementations for these algorithms have been extensively optimised.

Whilst the task ahead is daunting, the reward is commensurate with the risk. Success will enable a new generation of schedulers, able to address the challenges facing today's major technology companies.
