  Abstract                 = { We propose a new class of algorithms for linear cost network flow problems with and without gains. These algorithms are based on iterative improvement of a dual cost and operate in a manner that is reminiscent of coordinate ascent and Gauss-Seidel relaxation methods. We compare our coded implementations of these methods with mature state-of-the-art primal simplex and primal-dual codes, and find them to be several times faster on standard benchmark problems, and faster by an order of magnitude on large, randomly generated problems. Our experiments indicate that the speedup factor increases with problem dimension. },

  Abstract                 = { We develop a new approach to solving minimum-cost circulation problems. Our approach combines methods for solving the maximum flow problem with successive approximation techniques based on cost scaling. We measure the accuracy of a solution by the amount that the complementary slackness conditions are violated. We propose a simple minimum-cost circulation algorithm, one version of which runs in O(n3log(nC)) time on an n-vertex network with integer arc costs of absolute value at most C. By incorporating sophisticated data structures into the algorithm, we obtain a time bound of O(nm log(n2/m)log(nC)) on a network with m arcs. A slightly different use of our approach shows that a minimum-cost circulation can be computed by solving a sequence of O(n log(nC)) blocking flow problems. A corollary of this result is an O(n2(log n)log(nC))-time, m-processor parallel minimum-cost circulation algorithm. Our approach also yields strongly polynomial minimum-cost circulation algorithms. Our results provide evidence that the minimum-cost circulation problem is not much harder than the maximum flow problem. We believe that a suitable implementation of our method will perform extremely well in practice. },

  Abstract                 = {The article discusses mathematical methods, which may be used in organizing and planning industrial production. It is generally known that these methods are constantly met in technical economic problems, particularly in those dealing with the organization and planning of production. Many of these problems lead directly to problems A, B and C, as examined and therefore can be solved by these methods. Many other practical problems lead to mathematical problems, which are different from these but can still be solved by the same methods. Up to the present time all of these technical-economic problems have been solved more or less haphazardly by eye or by feel, and of course the solution obtained is only in rare cases the best. Moreover, the problem of finding the optimum has often never even been posed, and when it was posed it has not been possible in the majority of cases to solve it. The possibility now exists in a number of cases to obtain not an arbitrary solution but to find the optimum solution by a definite, scientifically based method.},
