\section{Distributed scheduling} \label{sec:prep-scheduling}
\subsection{Overview} \label{prep-scheduling-overview}
Overview of what the task is.

\subsection{Quincy and related systems} \label{prep-scheduling-quincy}
Explanation of how Quincy-style systems work. Expressing data centre as a flow network.

\section{Flow networks} \label{prep-flow}
What flow networks are. The min-cost max-flow problem.

\subsection{Definition} \label{prep-flow-definition}
What flow networks are. Introduce notation which you'll use throughout rest of document.

\subsection{The min-cost max-flow problem} \label{prep-flow-problem}
What I'm trying to solve. Formally define it.

\subsection{Properties}
\label{prep-flow-results}
MAYBE -- theorems/results/definitions used in later algorithms. I think it's best to define them right before discussing a particular algorithm, but some things (such as $\epsilon$-optimality) are common to multiple algorithms, so may be best 'uplifted' here.

\section{Software engineering} \label{sec:prep-sweng}

\subsection{Requirements analysis} \label{sec:prep-sweng-requirements}
What the system should do. Include table listing goals and their priorities, etc.

\subsection{Model}
State the model you used (something like Spiral probably closest fit). Elaborate on what it is. Justify choice: can reference constraints imposed by requirements, e.g. some of them risky/speculative so waterfall model inappropriate.

\subsection{Testing}
Summarize approach. Maybe make forwards reference to \ref{sec:prep-tools-testing}.

\section{Choice of tools} \label{sec:prep-tool-choice}
\subsection{Language and libraries}
Justify language choice (C++, Python). Libraries: GLOG, Boost.

Perhaps mention coding style guides?

\subsection{Development environment}
Physical machines used: laptop, MCS, SRG cluster.

Revision control: Git.

Backup strategy: GitHub. Daily snapshots backed up to MCS, SRCF, Copy (cloud).

CMake. IDE: Eclipse with plugins, vim.

\subsection{Testing environment} \label{sec:prep-tools-testing}
GTest for unit tests. Other automated tests: Python. Note that performance evaluation part of testing requires custom development: no pre-existing benchmark suites suitable.

\section{Initial experience}
My starting point. C++: from IB Tripos. Algorithms: IA/IB. Maths: IA. No prior knowledge of flow networks.

\section{Project schedule} \label{sec:prep-project-schedule}
How I planned my time. Split into phases. Core success criteria obtained early. Testing completed. Extensions added and additional experiments performed later on.
