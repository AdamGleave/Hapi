\section{Cluster scheduling} \label{sec:prep-scheduling}

% PROOFREAD: 1. Major edits. 2. Minor edits.

% TODO: Get some references from Malte/Ionel on this?
Much as an operating system scheduler maps threads to processor cores, a cluster scheduler maps tasks to machines. Better scheduling techniques can considerably improve performance: for example, throughput increased by 40\% under Quincy ~\cite{Isard:2009}. Due to their importance, cluster schedulers are an active area of research.

I start by outlining desirable properties of cluster schedulers. Following this, I summarise the prevailing approaches to scheduling. I conclude by discussing the principles underlying Firmament, showing how it improves upon competing approaches with its use of flow scheduling.

\subsection{Design goals} \label{sec:prep-scheduling-goals}

%WORDCOUNT: Could cut design goals down considerably, although I feel this is reasonably good stuff.

% PROOFREAD: 1. Major edits. 2. Minor edits.

% SOMEDAY: Rephrase 2nd sentence: "Moreover, ... may need to analyse a large amount of data ..."
To achieve optimal performance, the scheduling policy employed must be \emph{targeted} to the requirements of the workload. The scheduler may need to analyse a large amount of data, such as the resource requirements of each task and the utilisation of each machine, to \emph{effectively} implement a particular policy. All decisions should be made as \emph{fast} as possible, to support interactive applications. Furthermore, the system must be able to \emph{scale} to the size of modern clusters. These goals are summarised in \cref{table:cluster-scheduler-design-goals}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cl}
        \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
        \hline
        Targeted & Application requirements are reflected in the scheduler policy. \tabularnewline
        Effective & The schedules produced are optimal given the policy objectives. \tabularnewline
        Fast and scalable & Scheduling latency remains low even for large clusters. \tabularnewline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Cluster scheduler design goals}

\end{table}

%WORDCOUNT: Could cut next three paragraphs without losing much
%Scheduler policies can have a variety of objectives. For batch processing, job throughput may be the primary goal; for interactive jobs, low latency may be more important. Moreover, modern clusters are often multi-tenant: it is essential that the scheduler is \emph{fair}, providing an equitable distribution of resources between users. Naturally, objectives often conflict with each other, and a trade-off must be chosen.
%
%Getting the objectives right is hard, but implementing a scheduler which effectively achieves those objectives is still more difficult. Particularly challenging is the sheer amount of information that must be processed: as an example, consider the Whare-Map scheduler. It seeks to minimise \emph{co-location interference}: the degradation of performance occurring when tasks running on the same machine compete for shared resources~\cite{Mars:2013}\footnotemark. To achieve this objective, it monitors the performance of \emph{every} task running in the cluster, building up a profile of how applications interact.
%\footnotetext{In fact, the approach is more general than this: Whare-Map tries to take into account machine heterogeneity due to hardware differences as well.}
%
%% SOMEDAY: Terminology re: latency is a bit confused. Here you're talking about scheduling latency to do with the solver being slow. But in the next section you talk about latency due to policy: a FIFO queue.
%Finally, the system should remain responsive at scale. Today's warehouse scale computers contain tens of thousands of machines, running hundreds of thousands of tasks. Furthermore, these platforms now often run interactive applications: for example, a job may be spawned in response to a query in a data analytics platform, requiring sub-second scheduling latency~\cite{Ousterhout:2013}.

% FIGURES: Axes, distributed vs centralised and monolothic vs flexible

Commensurate with their importance, a variety of cluster scheduling designs have been investigated, summarised in \cref{table:cluster-scheduler-feature-matrix}. Traditionally, schedulers have been \emph{monolithic}, designed for a single workload. For example, the Hadoop Fair Scheduler only manages MapReduce jobs~\cite{HadoopFairSchedulerJIRA}.

Although monolithic schedulers may perform well on their intended workload, they cannot be targeted to different applications. Newer schedulers such as Mesos~\cite{Mesos} adopt a \emph{two-level} design~\cite[\S3.3]{Omega}: a centralised allocator dynamically partitions resources in the cluster between \emph{scheduling frameworks}, each of which implement a policy appropriate to the applications they manage. However, as each framework sees only a subset of the resources in the cluster, they are not as effective as monolithic schedulers.

To support interactive applications on large-scale clusters, there has been research into \emph{distributed} scheduling. These methods can be very fast. For example, the Sparrow scheduler achieves sub-\SI{100}{\milli\second} scheduling latency, employing a sampling mechanism to avoid maintaining any centralised state~\cite[fig.~10]{Ousterhout:2013}. However, the lack of global state imposes limits on the effectiveness of distributed schedulers.

\subsection{Firmament and flow scheduling}
%WORDCOUNT: Firmament and flow scheduling -- could probably trim

% PROOFREAD: 1. Major edits. Need to reread.

% SOMEDAY: Add citations

% Introduce flow scheduling: Quincy monolithic scheduler. Very effective: avoid heuristic approaches.
% Firmament generalises it: targeted, effective.
% But SLOW! What if we can solve this?
% Centralised scheduling, scaling to large clusters?

% Key benefit of flow scheduling: global optimisation? Flexible policy also useful.

\emph{Flow scheduling} models scheduling as an optimisation problem over flow networks (see \cref{sec:prep-flow-scheduling}). The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated in the pioneering Quincy system, which delivered a 40\% increase in throughput and reduced data transfer by $3.9\times$~\cite{Isard:2009}. 

Firmament generalises Quincy, allowing a variety of scheduling policies to be specified. Like with two-level schedulers, the policy can be chosen on a per-application basis. However, flow scheduling does not partition the cluster: solving the optimisation problem globally allows better scheduling decisions to be made.

Flow algorithms are notoriously difficult to parallelise, due to the global nature of the problem. Accordingly, the flow solver quickly becomes a bottleneck, leading some researchers to claim flow scheduling systems cannot scale~\cite[\S6]{Apollo}. In this dissertation, I design and implement new flow algorithms which allow these systems to compete with the fastest distributed schedulers.

\section{Flow networks} \label{sec:prep-flow}

I first define flow networks and their associated optimisation problems, before discussing the details of scheduling using flow networks. Following this, I summarise properties of flow networks useful for the analysis and design of flow algorithms.

\subsection{Introduction}

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits.

\subsubsection{Definitions and notation}

A \emph{flow network} is a weakly connected\footnotemark directed graph $G=(V,E)$.
\footnotetext{A directed graph is weakly connected if the undirected graph formed by replacing all directed arcs with undirected edges is itself connected.}

Each arc $(i,j)\in E$ has an associated \emph{capacity} (or \emph{upper	bound}\footnotemark) $u_{ij}$, and a \emph{cost} $c_{ij}$.
\footnotetext{Some authors include a lower bound $l_{ij}$, but this does not feature in flow scheduling. Moreover, any network featuring lower bounds can be transformed into an equivalent one without~\cite[p.~39]{Ahuja:1993}.}

Each vertex $i\in V$ has an associated supply/demand $b_{i}$. Vertex $i$ is said to be a \emph{supply vertex} if $b_{i}>0$, a \emph{demand vertex} if $b_{i}<0$ and a \emph{transshipment vertex} if $b(i)=0$.

The problems we will consider involve finding a solution vector $\mathbf{x}$,
specifying the flow $x_{ij}$ at each arc $(i,j)\in E$. A solution
$\mathbf{x}$ is \emph{feasible}, and we say it is a \emph{flow}, if it satisfies capacity constraints at every arc $(i,j) \in E$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:capacity-constraints}
0\leq x_{ij}\leq u_{ij},
\end{equation}

and mass balance constraints at each vertex $i \in V$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mass-balance-constraints}
\sum_{j\::\:(i,j)\in E}x_{ij}-\sum_{j\::\:(j,i)\in E}x_{ji}=b_i.
\end{equation}

That is, the net flow out of the vertex is exactly equal to the supply
at that vertex (which may be negative, in the case of demand vertices).

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

The following two assumptions hold for all flow scheduling networks, and will be used in the design and analysis of algorithms in the next chapter. \\

\begin{assumption}[Integrality] \label{assumption:integrality}
All quantities defining the flow network take on only integer values.\\
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}[Non-negative arc costs] \label{assumption:non-negative-arc-costs}
For all $(i,j) \in E$, $c_{ij} \geq 0$. \\
\end{assumption}

\subsubsection{The minimum-cost flow problem} \label{sec:prep-flow-mcf}

The well-known maximum flow problem involves finding a solution vector
$\mathbf{x}$ subject to constraints \cref{eq:capacity-constraints} and \cref{eq:mass-balance-constraints}, i.e.\ finding a feasible flow.

Flow scheduling requires solving a generalization of this, known as the minimum-cost flow (MCF) problem. Formally, it is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mcf-primal-problem}
\mbox{minimise}\ s(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{(i,j)\in E}c_{ij}x_{ij}
\end{equation}
subject to the constraint that $\mathbf{x}$ must be a feasible flow.

Note, in general, that the MCF and maximum flow problem may be infeasible. For example, the network might be imbalanced: $\sum_{i\in V}b_{i}\neq0$. All networks produced by Firmament are guaranteed to be solvable, however, so I will tend not to discuss this case\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{For robustness, all algorithms implemented as part of this project detect if a network is infeasible.}

\subsection{Scheduling using flows} \label{sec:prep-flow-scheduling}
% XXX: Rewrite details of flow scheduling. 
% WORDCOUNT: Could summarize Quincy, provide details in appendix.
Firmament and Quincy frame scheduling in terms of the minimum-cost flow problem. \emph{Jobs} are submitted to the scheduler, each consisting of a number of \emph{tasks}. Flow drains from task vertices to a sink vertex. Along the way, it passes either through a machine vertex (indicating the task is to be placed there) or a special job unscheduled aggregator vertex (indicating the task is to be left unscheduled).

Arc capacities are used to \emph{restrict} the possible scheduling assignments. The costs associated with arcs specify \emph{preferences} between possible scheduling assignments. Scheduling policies are therefore encoded in terms of a \emph{cost model}.

% TODO: Flow scheduling is somewhat confused between Quincy and general cost models.
% N.B. Skipped applying diffs here since may rewrite substantially.
% N.B. Ionel had comments here as well
\subsubsection{Network structure}

% PROOFREAD: 1 major edits, need to reread.

%FIGURE: Table summarising vertices
%FIGURE: Flow graphs

Each task $i$ in job $j$ is represented by a vertex $\mathbf{T}_i^j$, with a single unit of supply. Machines are represented by vertices $\mathbf{M}_l$, with arcs to a sink vertex $\mathbf{S}$. Task vertices have arcs to machine vertices, the arc cost specifying the task's preference for being scheduled on that machine.

There is a problem with this scheme: if there are more tasks submitted than can be scheduled, the flow problem becomes infeasible. To fix this, we introduce \emph{unscheduled aggregators} $\mathbf{U}^j$ for each job $j$, with an arc to $\mathbf{S}$. Each task vertex $\mathbf{T}_i^j$ has an arc to its unscheduled aggregator $\mathbf{U}_j$, with the cost specifying the penalty for being unscheduled.

In the model above, every task has an arc to each machine. Whilst this allows for the model to be highly precise, it is very inefficient\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{The number of arcs will scale linearly with the number of machines. But, of course, as the size of a cluster grows the number of tasks being scheduled will also tend to grow proportionally. So the number of arcs actually will tend to grow \emph{quadratically} with increases in the number of machines. Scalability is a key concern, making this is highly undesirable.}
Firmament adds support for \emph{equivalence classes}, which may be over tasks or machines\footnotemark. Each equivalence class has an aggregator vertex, with arcs to all vertices in the class. In this way, multiple arcs connecting to vertices in the same class can be combined into a single arc.
\footnotetext{In fact, Firmament supports representing resources at a finer grain than machines: for example, an individual core. So machines may themselves be aggregator vertices.}

The Quincy system provides a concrete example of an equivalence class. Each rack has an associated \emph{rack aggregator} vertex $\mathbf{R}_k$, with arcs to every machine in the rack. Moreover, a single \emph{cluster aggregator} $\mathbf{X}$ is introduced, with arcs to each rack aggregator. This scheme is appropriate for Quincy as its costs depend on inter-rack bandwidth usage, so will tend to be similar within a rack\footnote{Costs also depend on intra-rack bandwidth usage, but less weight is given to this factor as it is rarely a bottleneck.}. Rather than arcs from every task $\mathbf{T}_i^j$ to each machine, there is a single arc to $\mathbf{X}$ and a fixed number of arcs to preferred machines and racks.

\subsubsection{Capacities}

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits.
Every arc leaving a task vertex $\mathbf{T}_i^j$ has unit capacity. Note $\mathbf{T}_i^j$ has unit supply and no incoming arcs, so any (non-zero) capacity would be equivalent to unit capacity.

The arcs $\mathbf{M}_l \to \mathbf{S}$ from machine vertices to the sink vertex have capacity $K$, where $K$ is a parameter specifying the number of tasks which may concurrently run on a machine\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{In the original Quincy system, $K=1$. However, this is clearly a poor utilisation of modern multi-core machines. In fact, performance may often be improved by setting $K > \text{\# of cores}$, on simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) machines.}

The arcs $\mathbf{R}_k \to \mathbf{M}_l$ also have capacity $K$, since up to $K$ jobs may be scheduled on each machine in the rack via the aggregator. The arcs $\mathbf{X} \to \mathbf{R}_k$ have capacity $mK$, where $m$ is the number of machines in each rack\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{In fact, it would be perfectly legitimate to leave these arcs uncapacitated: the capacity on $\mathbf{M}_l \to \mathbf{S}$ will ensure there are not too many tasks scheduled. However, these capacity constraints may improve the efficiency of the solver.}

The arcs $\mathbf{U}^j \to \mathbf{S}$ can be set to be uncapacitated, allowing any number of tasks in job $j$ to be unscheduled. Firmament and Quincy, however, choose to enforce a lower bound $E_j$ and upper bound $F_j$ on the number of tasks that can be scheduled for each job. This can provide some degree of fairness, and in particular specifying $E_j \geq 1$ ensures starvation freedom.

Let $N_j$ be the number of tasks submitted for job $j$. To enforce the upper bound $F_j$, give $\mathbf{U}^j$ a demand of $N_j - F_j$. At least this many tasks in job $j$ must then be left unscheduled, guaranteeing no more than $F_j$ tasks are scheduled.

To enforce the lower bound, we set the capacity on $\mathbf{U}^j \to \mathbf{S}$ to $F_j - E_j$. The maximum number of unscheduled tasks is thus the $N_j - F_j$ which are absorbed at $\mathbf{U}^j$, plus the $F_j - E_j$ draining via $\mathbf{U}^j \to \mathbf{S}$. This gives an upper bound of $N_j - E_j$ unscheduled tasks, guaranteeing that at least $E_j$ tasks remain scheduled.

\subsubsection{Cost models}  

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits.

A key benefit of the flow scheduling approach is its flexibility: support for a policy can be added simply by defining a new cost model. The model used in the original Quincy system attempts to achieve \emph{data locality}: scheduling tasks close to their input data, in order to minimise network traffic. 

Firmament supports three other cost models~\cite[ch.~5]{Schwarzkopf:2015}. The Whare-Map and Coordinate Co-Location models aim to improve utilisation of resources in heterogeneous clusters. The Energy-Aware model seeks to achieve energy efficiency while meeting application performance guarantees, in clusters containing machines of varying performance and efficiency.

% SOMEDAY: Not happy with "having an intuition for how cost models operate is valuable", rephrase
Given such a variety of possible policies, the solver developed in this project must be independent of any particular cost model. However, having an intuition for how cost models operate is valuable. For reasons of brevity, I will only summarize the cost model in the original Quincy system. Further details of this model are available in~\cite{Isard:2009}. A description of the other models mentioned is in~\cite[ch.~5]{Schwarzkopf:2015}.

\end{table}

The arc costs specified by the Quincy model are given in \cref{table:quincy-costs}. All arcs not mentioned in this table have a cost of zero\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{In particular, arcs leaving aggregator vertices and arcs entering the sink have zero cost.}

The model assumes tasks process data residing in a distributed file system. Files may be accessed from any machine, with the file being fetched from a remote machines if there is no local copy. Retrieving a file from a machine in another rack is more expensive -- both in terms of request latency and network resources consumed -- than from a neighbouring machine. Reading the data from a directly connected disk is cheaper still. The Quincy scheduler quantifies the data transfer costs for each scheduling assignment. Solving the resulting minimum-cost flow problem yields an assignment which minimises the total data transfer cost, achieving data locality.

\Cref{table:quincy-variables} gives the variables maintained by the Quincy scheduler. All arc costs are functions of these variables. The system breaks down the data transfer of a task $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ into two components: transfer across the core switch, $\chi\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$, and top of rack switches, $\mathcal{R}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$.

For a particular machine $\mathbf{M}_m$, the data transfer $\chi_{m}^{M}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$ and $\mathcal{R}_{m}^{M}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$ can be computed exactly. However, when it comes to determining the cost of arcs to aggregator vertices $\mathbf{R}_l$ or $\mathbf{X}$, an exact figure is not possible. Instead, Quincy takes a conservative upper bound: the \emph{greatest} data transfer that results from scheduling $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ on the \emph{worst} machine in rack $\mathbf{R}_l$ or the cluster as a whole, respectively.

The system also keeps track of the time $\theta_i^j$ and $\nu_i^j$ a task spends scheduled and unscheduled, respectively. If the task is stopped and then restarted, these times continue to accumulate. This property is needed to guarantee the scheduler makes progress.

Quincy is controlled by three simple parameters, given in \cref{table:quincy-parameters}. $\epsilon$ and $\psi$ specify the cost of data transfers across core and top of rack switches respectively. In general, we would expect $\epsilon > \psi$, since the core switch is more likely to become a bottleneck. $\omega$ controls the penalty for leaving a task unscheduled\footnotemark. Increasing $\epsilon$ and $\psi$ will cause the scheduler to more aggressively optimise for data locality. Increasing $\omega$ will 
\footnotetext{It is possible to vary $\omega$ between jobs in order to encode a notion of priority.}

It is now possible to state formulae for the arc costs listed in \cref{table:quincy-costs}. For convenience, we will define the data transfer cost function:
\[d_{b}^{A}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right) = \epsilon\chi_{b}^{A}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)+\psi\mathcal{R}_{b}^{A}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)\]

The cost of scheduling on the worst machine in the cluster and the worst machine in rack $\mathbf{R}_l$ immediately follow from this:
\[\alpha_{i}^{j} = d^X\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)\]
\[\rho_{i}^{j,l} = d^R_l\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)\]
It is tempting to use the same form for the cost, $\gamma^j_{i,m}$ of scheduling on a particular machine $\mathbf{M}_m$. When $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ is not running on $\mathbf{M}_m$ (either it is unscheduled, or is running on a different machine), this is valid. 

However, this formula is inappropriate when $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ is already scheduled on  $\mathbf{M}_m$: $d^M_m\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$ will overestimate the cost of the remaining data transfer. To account for the work already invested in $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$, we subtract the time it has been running, giving:
\[\gamma_{i,m}^{j} = d_{m}^{M}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)-\begin{cases}
\theta_{i}^{j} & \text{if \ensuremath{\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}}running on \ensuremath{\mathbf{M}_{m}}}\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\]

The only remaining cost is $v_i^j$, the penalty associated with leaving a task $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ unscheduled. We set it proportional to the length of time it has been unscheduled:
\[v_i^j = \omega\nu_{n}^{j}\]

\subsubsection{Properties of these networks}

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits.

I state below some properties which hold for all flow scheduling networks. These will be useful in the next chapter, when analysing the complexity of algorithms. \\

% WORDCOUNT: Could shift the proofs to appendix, although keep the claims here.
\begin{restatable}[Number of vertices in flow scheduling networks]{lemma}{flowschedulingnumvertices}
\label{lemma:network-num-vertices}
Let $n$ denote the number of vertices in the network. Then $n = \Theta\left(\text{\# machines} + \text{\# tasks}\right)$.
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}
See \cref{appendix:flow-scheduling}.
\end{proof}

\begin{restatable}[Number of arcs in flow scheduling networks]{lemma}{flowschedulingnumarcs} 
\label{lemma:network-num-arcs}
Let $m$ denote the number of arcs in the network. Then $m = O(n)$. That is, the network is \emph{sparse}.
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}
See \cref{appendix:flow-scheduling}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Size of supply in flow scheduling networks] \label{lemma:network-supply}
The largest supply in the network is a unit supply.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The only vertices in the network with any supply are the task vertices, $\mathbf{T}_i^j$. These by definition have unit supply.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Most vertices in the network are transshipment vertices, with no demand nor supply. The demand vertices in the network are the sink vertex $\mathbf{S}$ and (optionally) unscheduled aggregators, $\mathbf{U}^j$. These may have a greater than unit demand.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Key concepts in flow algorithms}

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits except for Residual Networks which was major

In the preceding sections, I have formalised the notion of a flow network and outlined how cluster scheduling can be formulated in terms of the MCF problem. This section introduces some further definitions and properties of flow networks, necessary for the implementation and analysis of algorithms in the next chapter.

\subsubsection{Pseudoflows} \label{sec:prep-flow-pseudo}

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits

A \emph{pseudoflow} is a vector $\mathbf{x}$ which satisfies the capacity constraints
\cref{eq:capacity-constraints}, but which need not satisfy the mass balance constraints \cref{eq:mass-balance-constraints}. While all flow algorithms must return a feasible solution, many operate on pseudoflows in intermediate stages. 

The \emph{excess} at a vertex $i\in V$ is defined to be:

\begin{equation}
e_i=b_i+\sum_{\set{j | (j,i)\in E}}x_{ji}-\sum_{\set{j | (i,j)\in E}}x_{ij}.
\end{equation}

Vertex $i$ is said to be an \emph{excess vertex} if $e_{i}>0$, and a \emph{deficit vertex} if $e_{i}<0$ (with deficit $-e_{i}$). If $e_{i}=0$, $i$ is said to be \emph{balanced}. Note the mass balance constraints \cref{eq:mass-balance-constraints} hold if and only if all vertices are balanced.

\subsubsection{Residual networks}

% PROOFREAD: 1 major edits.

The notion of \emph{residual networks} is used in many flow algorithms. The residual network of $G$ is defined with respect to a (pseudo)flow $\mathbf{x}$, and is denoted by $G_{\mathbf{x}}$. Informally, it represents the actions an algorithm can take to modify the (pseudo)flow $\mathbf{x}$. In the case where $\mathbf{x=0},$ we have $G_{\mathbf{0}}=G$.

Formally, we define $G_{\mathbf{x}}=\left(V,E_{\mathbf{x}}\right)$ to be a directed graph where:
\begin{equation}
E_{\mathbf{x}}=\set{(i,j)\in V^{2} | (i,j)\in E\land x_{ij}<u_{ij}} \cup \set{(j,i)\in V^{2} | (i,j)\in E\land x_{ij}>0}. 
\end{equation}

The former set contains \emph{forward arcs}, present in the original flow network. Arcs $(i,j)$ which are \emph{saturated}, i.e.\ $x_{ij}=u_{ij}$, are omitted from the residual network: they do not allow for any additional flow to be pushed. The second set consists of \emph{backward arcs}, the reverse of arcs in the original network. Only arcs with positive flow in the original network have a corresponding backwards arc. Pushing flow along the backward arc corresponds to cancelling flow on the forward arc.

The \emph{residual capacity} of an arc $(i,j)\in E_{\mathbf{x}}$ is defined to be:

\begin{equation}
r_{ij}=\begin{cases}
u_{ij}-x_{ij} & ,\:(i,j)\:\mbox{is a forward arc;}\\
x_{ij} & ,\:(i,j)\:\mbox{is a reverse arc.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The cost of forward arcs is the same as in the original network, whereas the cost of a reverse arc $(j,i)$ is defined as $-c_{ij}$.

\subsubsection{Duality and reduced cost} \label{sec:prep-flow-rc-and-dual}

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits.

Every linear programming problem may be viewed from two perspectives, as either a \emph{primal} or \emph{dual} problem. Solutions to the dual problem provide a lower bound on the objective value of the primal problem. The primal version of the MCF problem was stated previously in \cref{sec:prep-flow-mcf}. 

To formulate the dual problem, it is necessary to associate with each vertex $i \in V$ a \emph{dual variable} $\pi_i$, called the \emph{vertex potential}. The \emph{reduced cost} of an arc $(i,j)\in E$ with respect to a potential vector $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:reduced-costs}
c_{ij}^{\boldsymbol{\pi}}=c_{ij}-\pi_{i}+\pi_{j}.
\end{equation}

The dual problem can now be stated as:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{maximise}\; w(\boldsymbol{\pi})=\sum_{i\in V}b_{i}\pi_{i}-\sum_{(i,j)\in E}\max\left(0,-c_{ij}^{\pi}\right)u_{ij}
\end{equation}
with no constraints on $\boldsymbol{\pi}$.

Many flow algorithms seek to solve the dual problem, as this may be computationally more efficient. Others try to enjoy the best of both worlds, operating on both the primal and dual versions of the problem.

\subsubsection{Optimality conditions} \label{sec:prep-flow-optimality}

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits.

Below, I give conditions for a solution vector $\mathbf{x}$ to be optimal. These may suggest algorithms for solving the problem, and are needed for correctness proofs in the subsequent chapter. \\

\begin{restatable}[Negative cycle optimality conditions]{thm}{optimalitynegcycle}
\label{thm:optimality-neg-cycle}
Let $\mathbf{x}$ be a (feasible) flow. It is an optimal solution to the minimum-cost flow problem if and only if the residual network $G_\mathbf{x}$ has no negative cost (directed) cycle.
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}
See Ahuja, \textit{et al.}~\cite[p.~307]{Ahuja:1993}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Reduced cost optimality conditions] \label{thm:optimality-reduced-cost}
Let $\mathbf{x}$ be a (feasible) flow. It is an optimal solution to the minimum-cost flow problem if and only if there exists a vertex potential vector $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ such that that the reduced cost of each arc in the residual network $G_{\mathbf{x}}$ is non-negative:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:optimality-reduced-cost}
\forall(i,j)\in E_{\mathbf{x}}\cdot c_{ij}^{\boldsymbol{\pi}}\geq 0
\end{equation}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
See Ahuja, \textit{et al.}~\cite[p.~309]{Ahuja:1993}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Complementary slackness optimality conditions] \label{thm:optimality-complementary-slackness}
Let $\mathbf{x}$ be a (feasible) flow. It is an optimal solution to the minimum-cost flow problem if and only if there exists a vertex potential vector $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ such that for every arc $(i,j)\in E$:

\normalfont % don't want text in maths italic
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:optimality-complementary-slackness}
\begin{align} 
\text{if \ensuremath{c_{ij}^{\boldsymbol{\pi}}>0}, } & \text{then \ensuremath{x_{ij}=0}} \\
\text{if \ensuremath{c_{ij}^{\boldsymbol{\pi}}<0}, } & \text{then \ensuremath{x_{ij}=u_{ij}}} \\
\text{if \ensuremath{c_{ij}^{\boldsymbol{\pi}}=0}, } & \text{then \ensuremath{0\leq x_{ij}\leq  u_{ij}}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The result follows immediately from expanding out \cref{eq:optimality-reduced-cost}, applying the definition of a residual network and performing a case analysis. A detailed proof is given by Ahuja, \textit{et al.}~\cite[p.~310]{Ahuja:1993}.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Notation for complexity analysis} \label{sec:prep-flow-complexity}

% PROOFREAD: 1 minor edits.

Here, I introduce notation that will be useful for stating the asymptotic complexity of algorithms. Let $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$ denote the number of vertices and arcs respectively.

The running time of algorithms may depend not just on the size of the network, but also on the magnitudes of input data. Let $U$ denote the largest vertex supply/demand, or arc capacity:
\begin{equation}
U=\max\left(\max\left\{ |b_{i}|\::\: i\in V\right\} ,\max\left\{ u_{ij}\::\:\left(i,j\right)\in E\right\} \right)
\end{equation}

and let $C$ denote the largest arc cost:

\begin{equation}
C=\max\left\{ c_{ij}\::\:(i,j)\in E\right\} 
\end{equation}

\section{Project management}

Before I could start to develop improved flow algorithms, it was necessary to understand the considerable body of prior work  summarised in \cref{sec:intro-related-work} and \cref{sec:prep-flow}. Consequently, reviewing the existing literature formed a key part of the preparatory stage of this project. 

Having mastered the background material, I began to refine the initial project proposal (see \cref{appendix:proposal}) into a concrete plan. To start with, I carefully reviewed the project's requirements, described in the next section. In the final two sections, I describe how I selected a development model and devised a testing strategy appropriate for the project's requirements.

\subsection{Requirements analysis} \label{sec:prep-management-requirements}

% SOMEDAY: Include dependency analysis?
% Matt did this and it was a big plus, but ultimately my dependence structure is much simpler; unsure if it's worth it?
% Implementation: strategy -> algorithms -> data structures
% Some common code, e.g. parsing.
% Evaluation: test harness -> simulator

% Requirements: based on success criteria and extensions in project proposal
% Requirements shown along with section satisfying them
% Quick summary?
% Core deliverables: 

The main goals for the project are listed in \cref{table:prep-project-requirements}, broadly following the success criteria and extensions suggested in the original project proposal.

% FIGURE: Make this prettier, not happy with "mid". Circles don't really work though.
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{clccc}
        \textbf{\#} & \textbf{Deliverable} & \textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Difficulty}
        \tabularnewline
        \hline
        & \textit{Success criteria} \tabularnewline
        S1 & Implement standard flow algorithms & High & Low & High \tabularnewline
        S2 & Design an approximate solver & High & Mid. & Low \tabularnewline

        & \textit{Optional extensions} \tabularnewline

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Project deliverables}
    \label{table:prep-project-requirements}
\end{table}

Core success criteria were assigned a high priority: work on extensions only began once all success criteria had been met (see \cref{sec:prep-implsched}). Most of the risk was concentrated in the approximate solver. This approach had not previously been attempted, so it was difficult to predict how it would perform.

I deemed extensions to be more risky. Although the incremental solution approach turned out to be highly successful (see \cref{sec:eval-incremental}), at the outset of the project it was unclear whether it was even possible to build such a solver. All extensions were rated medium or high difficulty, because of the considerable implementation work required.

\subsection{Development life cycle}
\label{sec:prep-management-model}

% Requirements mostly fixed
% Somewhat linear dependencies.
% But considerable uncertainty over what the best approach is: high risk.
% Want to 'fail early'.
% Build prototype of everything, including test infrastructure.
% Gradually build out algorithms, performing some early-stage testing.
% Investigate those which are most promising further, building out test code as needed.

% Different approach used for different parts of the system
% Standard algorithms: pretty much waterfall. You knew how they worked already.
% Test harness: iterative, were unclear which features were needed. But low risk. You knew how to make it work.
% Novel algorithms: evolutionary prototyping.

% Spiral model genuinely is the best option for you, and I think you can justify this.

% Intro of development models.
% Key goal: manage risk.
% Introduce Spiral process generator.
% Explain different stages of the process.
% Standard algorithms: low-risk, waterfall
% Test harness: incremental development, effectively sequences of waterfall
% New approaches: evolutionary prototyping

A software development life cycle or process provides structure to a project, dividing work into distinct phases to simplify management. This project has clearly defined requirements, suggesting a waterfall model. However, there was considerable uncertainty associated with the design of some deliverables: methods such as incremental development or evolutionary prototyping might be more appropriate in these cases. I adopted the \emph{spiral model}, a risk-driven life cycle \emph{generator}, which is able to accommodate such varying requirements.

The spiral model indicates that development of deliverables S1 and S3 in \cref{table:prep-project-requirements} should follow the \emph{waterfall} model: they are low risk, with precisely known requirements. By contrast, the test suite --- consisting of deliverables S4 and E2 --- used an \emph{incremental} development approach, with new tests added after other deliverables were completed.

Deliverables S2, E1 and E3 were all rated as medium or high risk. Their requirements were fairly well known, but there was significant uncertainty as to the appropriate design. \emph{Evolutionary prototyping} was followed in accordance with the spiral model, first constructing a robust prototype which is then repeatedly refined. Building a prototype early was invaluable for risk management: for example, it allowed the viability of the incremental solver (extension E1) to be confirmed before committing significant development time.

%FIGURE: Spiral model

\subsection{Testing strategy}
\label{sec:prep-management-testing}
I developed unit tests for each class. Where possible, I used the GTest framework (see \cref{appendix:tools-libraries}). However, testing of flow algorithms requires large external datasets: a Python test harness was developed to automate these tests. Integration tests with Firmament were also performed upon the completion of deliverables S1 and S3 (see \cref{sec:eval-test-correctness}).

Extensive performance evaluation was conducted. Anticipating this need, success criteria S4 and extension E2 deliver tools for benchmarking. Further details are provided in \cref{sec:impl-firmament}, \cref{sec:eval-benchmark-strategy} and \cref{appendix:impl-benchmark-harness}.

\section{Implementation schedule} \label{sec:prep-implsched}

%Split into phases:
%1. Standard algorithms.
%2. Testing and performance evaluation.
%3. Approximate solver.
%4. Incremental solver.
%5. Optimisations.
%Return to phase 2 after each stage. May need to extend it to support new test types. Show how this supports evolutionary prototyping, waterfall, incremental?
%
%Other ways of structuring it? Problems: phase 2 is kind of awkward. And standard algorithms weren't implemented in one pass, but rather as needed by particular solvers.
%1. Approximate solver.
%2. Testing and performance evaluation.
%3. Incremental solver.
%4. Optimisations.
%I kind of prefer this style, actually. It's more faithful to how the project actually proceeded, certainly.

% Segue in: previous section described high-level approach, now develop detailed plan for how to structure development.
% Outline the phases
% Justify the strategy
% Keep it simple

For a project of this scope, it is essential to plan the work before commencing development. An implementation schedule was devised, following the high-level strategy described in the preceding section, dividing the project into the following phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{itm:phase-approximate}
        \textbf{Approximate solver} -- develop an algorithm to find approximate solutions to the MCF problem. Provided success criteria S1, S2 and S3; see \cref{sec:impl-approx}.
    \item \label{itm:phase-evaluation} 
        \textbf{Performance evaluation} -- run experiments to determine the speed-up offered by the system. This required development of a benchmark suite to facilitate testing, and provided deliverables S4 and E2; see \cref{chap:eval}.
    \item \label{itm:phase-incremental} 
        \textbf{Incremental solver} -- develop an algorithm solving the minimum-cost flow problem on sequences of related flow networks. The method reuses solutions to previous networks in the sequence to improve performance. Provided deliverable E1; see \cref{sec:impl-incremental}.
    \item \label{itm:phase-optimisations}
        \textbf{Optimisations} -- previous phases focused on improvements in \emph{algorithmic} techniques. In practice, performance is heavily dependent on the \emph{implementation} of the algorithm. Consequently, optimisations were necessary for the project to be competitive with existing solvers. Delivers extension E3; see \cref{sec:eval-optimisations}.
\end{enumerate}

All core success criteria were satisfied after the completion of the first two phases. This ensured the key goals of the project were met before work on extensions commenced. 

%Optimisation was postponed to the last phase. As \emph{evolutionary prototyping} was used for development of the approximate and incremental solvers (see \cref{sec:prep-management-model}), optimisation during phases \ref{itm:phase-approximate} or \ref{itm:phase-incremental} would have been premature. Leaving it to the final phase also ensures that time will only be spent on optimisation when all other goals have been met, appropriate as it is the lowest priority deliverable in \cref{table:prep-project-requirements}.
%
%Phase \ref{itm:phase-evaluation} is revisited upon the completion of phase \ref{itm:phase-incremental}, and after each optimisation in phase \ref{itm:phase-optimisations}. The development of the benchmark suite (see \cref{appendix:impl-benchmark-harness}) during phase \ref{itm:phase-evaluation} allows for the tests to be performed with little manual intervention, minimising the cost of revisiting this phase.

\section{Choice of tools}

\subsection{Languages} 

\subsubsection{C++}
I implemented the minimum-cost flow algorithms in C++. The performance of C++ is on par with low-level languages like C, with a number of excellent optimising compilers\footnotemark. At the same time, it adds support for object oriented programming and other features typical of high-level languages.
\footnotetext{Clang and GCC were used in this project.}

\subsubsection{Python and shell}
I used the Python scripting language for the development of test harnesses (see \cref{sec:eval-test-correctness} and \cref{appendix:impl-benchmark-harness}), and for generation of many of the figures appearing in \cref{chap:eval}. As a high-level language, Python aided productivity, although it was not used for any performance critical code. Shell scripting was used for particularly simple tasks, that involved plumbing together UNIX utilities. Python was favoured for anything more complicated, however, as it allows for a more structured programming style.

\subsection{Libraries} \label{sec:prep-tools-libraries}

Hapi uses two libraries developed at Google --- glog and gtest --- for logging and unit tests. I also extensively used the Boost family of libraries. See \cref{appendix:tools-libraries} for details of how I used the libraries, and a justification of my choice. 

\subsection{Flow scheduling}

The Firmament cluster scheduling platform is used for testing this project. The only other flow scheduling system in existence is Quincy, which pioneered the approach; however, Quincy is not publicly available.

\subsection{Revision control and backup strategy}

The Git distributed revision control system was used to manage the project source code, along with the {\LaTeX} code for this dissertation. Each Git working directory is a clone of the repository, complete with versioning history. The benchmark suite makes extensive use of this distributed nature of Git (see \cref{appendix:impl-benchmark-harness}).

To simplify testing, commits were automatically pushed to test machines in the SRG cluster, via a Git hook. Furthermore, changes were regularly pushed to GitHub, a popular repository hosting service.

Given the distributed nature of Git, having multiple working copies as described above automatically provides data replication. However, it would be possible for all copies of the repository to become corrupted due to user error, so this could not be relied upon as a backup strategy. Moreover, some files were not stored in Git\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{For example, test data files were often large, so had to be stored outside of Git.}

To protect against these threats, nightly backups were taken using a cron job. This took snapshots of the Git repository using \code{git-bundle}. Copies of other project files were made using \code{rdiff-backup}, which maintains a history of changes without the overhead of a full version control system like Git.

Copies of the resulting snapshots were stored on the university MCS and the Student Run Computing Facility (SRCF) in Cambridge. Additional off-site backups were made to Copy, a cloud storage service based in the US.

\section{Summary}

In this chapter, I have outlined the work undertaken prior to starting implementation for this project. I summarised the current state of the art cluster schedulers in \cref{sec:prep-scheduling}, and showed how flow scheduling can improve upon it. Next, I provided some elementary background on flow networks, and outlined how scheduling can be expressed in terms of a flow problem.

After having surveyed the research area, I turned to more practical considerations. I started by conducting a requirements analysis, identifying an appropriate software development life cycle taking into account the risk profile of the requirements. Next, I developed a concrete plan of implementation using the aforementioned techniques. Finally, I identified the tools I would use during implementation. In the next chapter, I describe the algorithms developed in this project.
