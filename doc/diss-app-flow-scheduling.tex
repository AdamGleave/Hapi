In Firmament, scheduling policies are represented in terms of a \emph{cost model}. As the name suggests, this specifies the costs of arcs. It also determines the network structure, grouping tasks and resources into \emph{equivalence classes}. In this section, I describe how I ported Quincy to this model. Details of the implementation work are provided in \cref{sec:impl-firmament} and \cref{sec:eval-benchmark-strategy-quincy}. For a more thorough description of the general framework and other examples of cost models, see Schwarzkopf~\cite[ch.~5]{Schwarzkopf:2015}.

%FIGURE-LOWPRI: Table summarising vertices

\Cref{fig:flow-network-no-costs-appendix} depicts a Quincy flow network, on a cluster of four machines scheduling two jobs with a total of five tasks.

Each task $i$ in job $j$ is represented by a vertex $\mathbf{T}_i^j$, with a single unit of supply. Machines are represented by vertices $\mathbf{M}_l$, with arcs to a sink vertex $\mathbf{S}$. Task vertices have arcs to machine vertices or aggregators, the arc cost specifying the task's preference for being scheduled on that machine.

There may be more tasks than can be scheduled. To ensure the flow problem is always feasible, \emph{unscheduled aggregators} $\mathbf{U}^j$ exist for each job $j$, allowing excess flow to drain to the sink $\mathbf{S}$. Each task vertex $\mathbf{T}_i^j$ has an arc to its unscheduled aggregator $\mathbf{U}_j$, with the cost specifying the penalty for being unscheduled.

Although it would be possible for each task to have an arc to every machine, this would result in a much larger network than necessary. Firmament has support for \emph{equivalence classes}, which may be over tasks or resources\footnotemark. Each equivalence class has an aggregator vertex, with arcs to all vertices in the class. In this way, multiple arcs connecting to vertices in the same class can be combined into a single arc.
\footnotetext{In the simplest model, each machine is a resource. However, a more fine-grained representation than this is possible, such as modelling individual processor cores.}

The Quincy system provides a concrete example of an equivalence class. Each rack has an associated \emph{rack aggregator} vertex $\mathbf{R}_k$, with arcs to every machine in the rack. Moreover, a single \emph{cluster aggregator} $\mathbf{X}$ is introduced, with arcs to each rack aggregator. Each task has a single arc to $\mathbf{X}$, and \emph{preference arcs} to favoured machines and racks.
%This scheme is appropriate for Quincy as its costs depend on inter-rack bandwidth usage, which will tend to be similar within a rack\footnote{Costs also depend on intra-rack bandwidth usage, but less weight is given to this factor as it is rarely a bottleneck.}.

\section{Capacities} \label{appendix:flow-scheduling:capacities}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{figures/flow/quincy-example-capacities}
    \caption[Capacities on a Quincy scheduling flow network]{The network previously depicted in \cref{fig:flow-network-no-costs-appendix} with an example flow. Each arc has a label \texttt{flow} / \texttt{capacity}, with those carrying flow in \textbf{\color{red} red}. Note $K=1$ for this example: at most one task can run on each machine. The scheduling assignment depicted is $T^0_0$ unscheduled, $T_0^1$ on $M_1$ (i.e.\ it is not moved) and $T_0^1$ on its preferred machine $M_3$ with $T_0^2$ and $T_1^1$ being scheduled on any idle machine. \newline \newline
    Quincy sets the upper bound $F_j$ on the number of running tasks to equal the number of machines divided by the number of jobs. So, $F_j = 2$ in this example. Accordingly, $\mathbf{U}_0$ has a demand of $1$. Hence the flow entering $\mathbf{U}_0$ from $\mathbf{T}_0^0$ does not leave the vertex.}
    \label{fig:flow-network-capacities}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:flow-network-capacities} shows arc capacities for the previous example network, along with a possible solution to the network. 

Every arc leaving a task vertex $\mathbf{T}_i^j$ has unit capacity. Note $\mathbf{T}_i^j$ has unit supply and no incoming arcs, so any (non-zero) capacity would be equivalent to unit capacity.

The arcs $\mathbf{M}_l \to \mathbf{S}$ from machine vertices to the sink vertex have capacity $K$, where $K$ is a parameter specifying the number of tasks which may concurrently run on a machine\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{In the original Quincy system, $K=1$. However, this is clearly a poor utilisation of modern multi-core machines. In fact, performance may be improved by setting $K > \text{\# of cores}$, on simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) machines.}

The arcs $\mathbf{R}_k \to \mathbf{M}_l$ also have capacity $K$, since up to $K$ jobs may be scheduled on each machine in the rack via the aggregator. The arcs $\mathbf{X} \to \mathbf{R}_k$ have capacity $mK$, where $m$ is the number of machines in each rack\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{In fact, it would be perfectly legitimate to leave these arcs uncapacitated: the capacity on $\mathbf{M}_l \to \mathbf{S}$ will ensure there are not too many tasks scheduled. However, these capacity constraints may improve the efficiency of the solver.}

The arcs $\mathbf{U}^j \to \mathbf{S}$ can be uncapacitated, allowing any number of tasks in job $j$ to be unscheduled. Firmament and Quincy, however, choose to enforce a lower bound $E_j$ and upper bound $F_j$ on the number of tasks that can be scheduled for each job. This can provide some degree of fairness, and in particular specifying $E_j \geq 1$ ensures starvation freedom~\cite[p.~19]{Isard:2009}.

Let $N_j$ be the number of tasks submitted for job $j$. To enforce the upper bound $F_j$, give $\mathbf{U}^j$ a demand of $N_j - F_j$. At least this many tasks in job $j$ must then be left unscheduled, guaranteeing no more than $F_j$ tasks are scheduled.

To enforce the lower bound, set the capacity on $\mathbf{U}^j \to \mathbf{S}$ to $F_j - E_j$. The maximum number of unscheduled tasks is thus the $N_j - F_j$ which are absorbed at $\mathbf{U}^j$, plus the $F_j - E_j$ draining via $\mathbf{U}^j \to \mathbf{S}$. This gives an upper bound of $N_j - E_j$ unscheduled tasks, guaranteeing that at least $E_j$ tasks remain scheduled.

Quincy seeks to achieve \emph{data locality}: scheduling tasks close to their input data, in order to minimise network traffic. Consequently, the arc costs (given in \cref{table:quincy-costs}) depend on bandwidth consumption of the task. \Cref{fig:flow-network-capacities} show these costs on the example network.

The model assumes that tasks process data residing in a distributed file system. Files may be accessed from any machine, with the file being fetched from remote machines if there is no local copy. 

Retrieving a file from a machine in another rack is more expensive -- both in terms of request latency and network resources consumed -- than from a neighbouring machine. Reading the data from a directly connected disk is cheaper still. The Quincy scheduler quantifies the data transfer costs for each scheduling assignment. Solving the resulting minimum-cost flow problem yields an assignment which minimises the total data transfer cost, achieving data locality.

\Cref{table:quincy-variables} gives the variables maintained by the Quincy scheduler. All arc costs are functions of these variables. The system breaks down the data transfer of a task $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ into two components: transfer across the core switch, $\chi\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$, and top of rack switches, $\mathcal{R}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$.

For a particular machine $\mathbf{M}_m$, the data transfer $\chi_{m}^{M}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$ and $\mathcal{R}_{m}^{M}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$ can be computed exactly. However, when it comes to determining the cost of arcs to aggregator vertices $\mathbf{R}_l$ or $\mathbf{X}$, an exact figure is not possible. Instead, Quincy takes a conservative upper bound: the \emph{greatest} data transfer that results from scheduling $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ on the \emph{worst} machine in rack $\mathbf{R}_l$ or the cluster as a whole, respectively.

The system also keeps track of the time $\theta_i^j$ and $\nu_i^j$ a task spends scheduled and unscheduled, respectively. If the task is stopped and then restarted, these times continue to accumulate. This property is needed to guarantee that the scheduler makes progress~\cite[p.~19]{Isard:2009}..

Quincy is controlled by three simple parameters, given in \cref{table:quincy-parameters}. $\epsilon$ and $\psi$ specify the cost of data transfers across core and top of rack switches respectively. In general, we would expect $\epsilon > \psi$, since the core switch is more likely to become a bottleneck. $\omega$ controls the penalty for leaving a task unscheduled\footnotemark. Increasing $\epsilon$ and $\psi$ causes the scheduler to more aggressively optimise for data locality, whereas increasing $\omega$ decreases queuing delay.
\footnotetext{It is possible to vary $\omega$ between jobs in order to encode a notion of priority.}

It is now possible to state formulae for the arc costs listed in \cref{table:quincy-costs}. For convenience, define the data transfer cost function:
\[d_{b}^{A}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right) = \epsilon\chi_{b}^{A}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)+\psi\mathcal{R}_{b}^{A}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)\]

The cost of scheduling on the worst machine in the cluster and the worst machine in rack $\mathbf{R}_l$ can be immediately stated from this:
\[\alpha_{i}^{j} = d^X\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right);\]
\[\rho_{i}^{j,l} = d^R_l\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right).\]
It is tempting to use the same form for the cost, $\gamma^j_{i,m}$ of scheduling on a particular machine $\mathbf{M}_m$. When $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ is not running on $\mathbf{M}_m$ (either it is unscheduled, or is running on a different machine), this is valid. 

However, this formula is inappropriate when $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ is already scheduled on  $\mathbf{M}_m$: $d^M_m\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)$ will overestimate the cost of the remaining data transfer. To account for the work already invested in $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$, the time it has been running is subtracted from the data transfer cost, giving:
\[\gamma_{i,m}^{j} = d_{m}^{M}\left(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}\right)-\begin{cases}
\theta_{i}^{j} & \text{if \ensuremath{\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}} running on \ensuremath{\mathbf{M}_{m}};}\\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]

The only remaining cost is $v_i^j$, the penalty associated with leaving a task $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{j}$ unscheduled. Quincy sets set it proportional to the length of time it has been unscheduled:
\[v_i^j = \omega\nu_{n}^{j}\]

\section{Properties} \label{appendix:flow-scheduling:properties}

Although the costs assigned to arcs vary between policies, the structure of the network remains the same. Some simple properties are proved below, which will be useful when analysing the asymptotic complexity of algorithms. \\

\flowschedulingnumvertices*
\begin{proof}
There is one vertex $\mathbf{T}_i^j$ for every task and one vertex $\mathbf{M}_m$ for every machine, so trivially $n = \Omega\left(\text{\# machines} + \text{\# tasks}\right)$.

It remains to show $n = O\left(\text{\# machines} + \text{\# tasks}\right)$. Consider each class of vertex in turn.

As stated above $\text{\# task vertices} = \text{\# tasks}$ and $\text{\# machine vertices} = \text{\# machines}$. There is an unscheduled aggregator $\mathbf{U}^j$ for each job $j$, and $\text{\# jobs} = O\left(\text{\# tasks}\right)$. There is at least one machine in every rack, so $\text{\# rack aggregator vertices} = O\left(\text{\# machines}\right)$. 

In addition, there is also a cluster aggregator vertex $\mathbf{X}$ and sink vertex $\mathbf{S}$ which are independent of the number of tasks and machines, contributing $O(1)$ vertices.

Thus:
\[n = O\left(\text{\# tasks} + \text{\# machines} + 1\right) = O\left(\text{\# tasks} + \text{\# machines}\right)\]

Hence:
\[n = \Theta\left(\text{\# machines} + \text{\# tasks}\right)\]
\end{proof}

\flowschedulingnumarcs*
\begin{proof}
Consider the outgoing arcs from each class of vertex. Since every arc is outgoing from exactly one vertex, this will count every vertex exactly once.

Each machine $\mathbf{M}_l$ and unscheduled aggregator $\mathbf{U}^j$ has a single outgoing arc, to sink vertex $\mathbf{S}$. This contributes $O\left(\text{\# machines}\right)$ arcs. The sink vertex $\mathbf{S}$ has no outgoing arcs.

Rack aggregators $\mathbf{R}_l$ have outgoing arcs to each machine in their rack. Each machine is present in exactly one rack, so these contribute collectively $O\left(\text{\# machines}\right)$ arcs. The cluster aggregator $\mathbf{X}$ has outgoing arcs to each rack; since $O\left(\text{\# racks}\right) = O\left(\text{\# machines}\right)$, this contributes $O\left(\text{\# machines}\right)$ arcs.

It remains to consider task vertices $\mathbf{T}_i^j$. The number of arcs leaving the task vertex has a constant upper bound. The system computes a \emph{preference list} of machines and racks, and includes arcs only to those vertices (and the cluster aggregator $\mathbf{X}$). Thus this contributes $O\left(\text{\# tasks}\right)$ arcs.

Hence:
\[m = \left(\text{\# machines} + \text{\# tasks}\right)\]
By \cref{lemma:network-num-vertices}, it follows:
\[m = O(n)\]
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
In fact, $m = \Theta(n)$: the network is connected so certainly $m = \Omega(n)$. However, I will only use the bound $m = O(n)$.
\end{remark}
